  Responsive Web Design(RWD)
  <ul>
    <li>Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen
      size. Responsive web design is focused around providing an
      intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone.</li>
    <li> Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and
      flexible media. </li>
    <li>Flexible layouts is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of
      dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages
      or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or
      padding.</li>
    <li>Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles.
      Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the
      width of the viewport or device orientation for example. </li>
    <li>Flexible Media. As viewports begin to change size media doesnâ€™t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other
      media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.</li>
  </ul>
